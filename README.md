# COINiD Wallet

Proper readme coming soon. If you have any questions you can contact us on our [Telegram] or via [email].

#### Secrets.js
We are currently not including the secrets.js in the repo. If you want to compile the wallet to test it you need to add the following to src/config/secrets.js.
```
export const p2pCommonSecret = '';
export const encryptPrivateSalt = '';
export const pinSecret = '';
```
